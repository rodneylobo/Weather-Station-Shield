# Weather-Station-Shield
This Arduino Nano shield was used in developing Weather Stations
It used  Humidity sensor, Carbon dioxide sensor, Light intensity sensor (photoresistor), Air Pressure sensor and Temperature sensor.
All of these can be displayed using the LCD
It also uses a bluetooth to wirelessely send the collected data to cell phones.
All that needs to be done is etch the pcb, and solder appropriate components.
Components required:
  1. FR1 boards (FR4 are better, actually)
  2. Female Header pins
  3. 16X2 LCD
  4. Trimpot (103 or above)
  5. 2.5 mm DC female jack
  6. Resistors (x3)
  7. 3mm LED (x2)
  8. Arduino Nano
  9. Photoresistor
  10. DHT11 (humidity sensor)
  11. BMP180 (air pressure sensor)
  12. MQ135 (carbon dioxide/ Air Quality sensor)
  13. LM35 (temperature sensor)
  14. Bluetooth module (HC05 or HC06)
  15. 9V battery and battery connector
  16. 2.5mm male DC jack
  17. Single strand wires
  18. Solder and soldering iron
